# Multi-Monitor Mouse Finder

> *Formerly known as "Cursor-track-find" â€” renamed to better reflect what it does.*


## What is this?

Just a little fun side project I made as a computer science student to help find the mouse cursor quicklyâ€”especially if youâ€™re using multiple monitors. I actually use this myself on my PC, and thought, why not share it with others who might find it handy?

It started as a simple experiment because I couldnâ€™t find any good lightweight tools that worked well across multiple screens without hogging resources. Since itâ€™s my own code, I know exactly what it does under the hood (no surprises there!). After some rounds of improvements with AI tools like Claude 4.0 and others, I think the code got quite a bit leaner and better.

If you want to try it, great! If not, no worries â€” this is just a small project Iâ€™m sharing for fun and convenience. Feel free to use it, improve it, or ignore it entirely. ðŸ™‚

## Why would you use this?

* Itâ€™s super lightweight (memory usage dropped from about 1.2MB to under 1MB after AI optimizations!)
* It works smoothly across multiple monitors
* No flashy animations or big system resource drainâ€”just subtle arrows on screen edges pointing to where your cursor is
* No external dependencies â€” pure native Windows API in C
* Runs quietly in the background with a simple tray icon
* Open source, so you can see all the code or tweak it yourself

## How it compares

Windows has a built-in option to locate your cursor by pressing CTRL, and Microsoft PowerToys offers fancy mouse utilities with more visual flair but also more resource use. I made this because I wanted something minimal, always-on, and reliable for multi-monitor setups without the bloat.

## Known quirks

* Overlay might hide behind fullscreen apps sometimes
* Itâ€™s unsigned and new, so Windows might warn you when installing. Just choose "Run anyway" if you trust it.
